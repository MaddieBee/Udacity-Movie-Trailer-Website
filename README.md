Read Me File Created By Madison Bold for the Udacity Movie Trailer Website Project.  

In order to be able to successfully initialize the move trailer website, entertainmentcenter.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, and media.py must all be located within the same folder.  

With the file entertainmentcenter.py open, run the file in a Python console.  This should take the movie class from media.py, and the webpage structure from fresh_tomatoes.py, and generate an HTML file in a webbrowser that displays all 6 movie box art images and the titles of the movies underneath them.  Clicking on a given picture will automatically open a movie trailer (from youtube) that can be paused with a subsequent click.
